## What is ButterFaces_RTL?


<br/>
<br/>
ButterFaces is a JSF 2 component enrichment framework. It wrappes most of default JSF 2 components and adds labels, readonly-views, tooltips, placeholder, validation style class marker and other nice features to the standard JSF 2 components.

## Why ButterFaces_RTL?

<br/>
<br/>
ButterFaces creates a simple html structure based on [twitters bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com/) around existing JSF components. You do not have already use bootstrap in your project - it comes with ButterFaces. And if you do not want to use bootstrap styles or you have your own version you can disable it easily by configuring it in your web.xml.

## What about the license?
